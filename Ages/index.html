        <h2>First Era</h2>
        <p>This was an age of chaos, where the dwarves wandered in scattered bands, pursued by monstrous forces that stalked the wilds. They had no strongholds, no alliances ‚Äî only the instinct to endure and the courage to fight when all else failed.</p>
        <p>Yet within the forge-smoke and bloodshed, a culture began to take root. The dwarves etched runes of defiance, learned to shape metal with flame, and sowed the first seeds of unity. Though primitive and hardened, they began to glimpse a destiny greater than mere survival.</p>

        <h2>Second Era</h2>
        <p>Out of fire and frost rose a warrior of unmatched might ‚Äî a leader who united the dwarves and raised their first great stronghold from the wilderness. Under this guardian, the clans stood as one, carving out order from the jaws of a monstrous world.</p>
        <p>They bested beasts, braved blizzards, and sealed the dread Frost King within a tomb of ice, bound by runes and ancient trials. Deep beneath the molten earth, they imprisoned Basaltor, a hulking terror of living stone, locking him away in a dimension of lava. In this age of glory, their forges roared with mastery, shaping iron into weapons of renown and crafting machines that held memory in runes and metal. From sunken pits, they drew spice from desert-born Sandtrout ‚Äî a rare substance that hardened iron and enriched their feasts.</p>
        <p>But with the passing of ages, the champion‚Äôs name was lost. His tale, once carved in stone and sung in halls, faded into fragmented myth. Murals cracked, and runes wore thin ‚Äî yet the unity he forged endured. The dwarves remembered not the hand that led them, but the world that hand had shaped.</p>

        <h2>Third Era</h2>
        <p>Calamity struck again, not from armies ‚Äî but from the Iron-Tusked Doom, a boar of colossal fury that razed their village and shattered their spirit. Their once-thriving homeland was lost beneath the beast‚Äôs wrath, abandoned to the silence of ruin.</p>
        <p>The dwarves, broken but unbowed, fled and founded a new settlement. Their ancient knowledge, their forges, and their legacy ‚Äî all were swallowed by time. In this new place, they began again from ash and memory, clinging to stories and instincts passed down in hushed voices.</p>
